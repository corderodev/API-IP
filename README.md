# API IP

Project to consume an api by passing an ip number, and returning all related information to the provider.
The idea for this project comes from [Midudev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AMKwVcpYTk).

In it I have learned and put into practice:
- Consuming an API (from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/ipregistry3-ipregistry/api/ip-geolocation-and-threat-detection/)).
- Display the information delivered by the API.
- Use the [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/) framework.
- Use of HTML ```<pre></pre>``` tag.
- And use a pattern input HTML.
